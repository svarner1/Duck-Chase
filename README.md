# Duck-Chase
This is a game that I created in 2019 for my AP Computer Science Exam "Creative Task." I used Code.org's App Lab platform to create the game application.

A short description: 
Duck Chase is a simple clicker game that makes ducks appear around the player's screen. The goal of the game is to tap as many ducks as you can within 30 seconds. When the ducks are clicked it adds to the player's score.
