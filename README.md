# Duck-Chase
This is a game that I created in 2019 for my AP Computer Science Exam "Creative Task." I used Code.org's App Lab platform to create the game application.

A short description: 
Duck Chase is a simple clicker game that makes ducks appear around the player's screen. The goal of the game is to tap as many ducks as you can within 30 seconds. When the ducks are clicked it adds to the player's score.

  javascript that applab uses to run your app.

* `index.html` - This is the html file that you designed in applab using the
  Design tab. It contains all the buttons, text inputs, and other controls for
  your app. Go here to add additional controls to your app.

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in your
  app that you specified under the Design tab. Go here to change the colors,
  positions, dimensions, and other properties of your app's controls.

* `code.js` - This file has all the code you wrote for your app. Go here to add
  new behavior to your app.

* `assets` - This is a directory with all the asset files (pictures and sounds)
